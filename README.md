## üìù Description
Trees with very large crown areas are very few, and most of the trees fall into the smaller crown areas.  
That is why the mean crown area and the mean crown diameter are also small.  

Applying different segmentation algorithms on tree crown polygons, the result was the best fitting segmentation algorithm for the above set of trees is **li2012**.  
After trying out multiple values for the window size, the resulting conclusion was that with assigning a minimum height value of **15** and window sizes from **5 to 11**, we get segmentation results that fit tree crown polygons.
